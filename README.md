## Intro

This is an early hobby project that I've been working on for many years. It's gone through dozens of iterations and was mostly a toy project to play around with various languages/tech. The repository here however is something more stable and I intend to build upon it for other folks to also use.

## Overview

The goal of this app is to easily produce a garden "map" that ultimately becomes your guide for gardening during the season. You build a garden, it recommends where to (and not to) put plants based on neighbors and once built the app helps set things in motion for a successful garden. Throughout the season, you'll be reminded to prepare your beds, add fertilizer/compost depending on if you're going organic or not and when to plant indoors or outdoors among other helpful tips.

## Todo

Everything. :) This is an early project and I always intend to build it every winter in time for Spring.
